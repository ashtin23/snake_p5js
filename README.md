# Snake
## Using p5 JS

#### Snake is a recreation of the vintage snake game.

#### I took on this project to learn to make light browser games and canvases and to get acquainted with the p5 JS library. It is the first game I have created. It is currently the MVP I sought to complete, and includes basic funtionality such as a score keeper and a reset button. Eventually, I would like to add the ability to keep track of a high score and display it on the UI. Also, I would like to add more styling to the background to make it appear as if it is an actual arcade game. I also am going to add different difficulty levels which encompass either faster speeds and/or smaller canvases.

## How to Play
#### The user can control the movements of the snake by utilizing the up, right, down, and left arrow keys. The goal is to eat as much food (red blocks) as possible. With each successive piece of food eaten, the body of the snake grows one block. Game over occurs if the snake runs into the wall or into itself.
