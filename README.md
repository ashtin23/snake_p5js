# Snake
## Using p5 JS

Snake is a recreation of the vintage snake game.

I took on this project to learn to make light browser games and canvases and to get acquainted with the p5 JS library. It is the first game I have created. It is currently the MVP I sought to complete, and includes basic funtionality such as a score keeper and a reset button. Eventually, I would like to add the ability to keep track of a high score and display it on the UI. Also, I would like to add more styling to the background as well as the death screen, which is currently a simple red screen.
